//   - Alice and Bob have a channel.
//   - Alice sends an HTLC to Bob, and Bob won't settle it.
//   - Alice goes offline.
//   - Bob force closes the channel and claims the HTLC using the preimage using
//     a sweeping tx.

// happens in the same block where it's spent.

// flakeInconsistentHTLCView documents a flake found that the `ListChannels` RPC
// can give inaccurate HTLC states, which is found when we call
// `AssertHTLCNotActive` after a commitment dance is finished. Suppose Carol is
// settling an invoice with Bob, from Bob's PoV, a typical healthy settlement
// flow goes like this:
//
//	[DBG] PEER brontide.go:2412: Peer([Carol]): Received UpdateFulfillHTLC
//	[DBG] HSWC switch.go:1315: Closed completed SETTLE circuit for ...
//	[INF] HSWC switch.go:3044: Forwarded HTLC...
//	[DBG] PEER brontide.go:2412: Peer([Carol]): Received CommitSig
//	[DBG] PEER brontide.go:2412: Peer([Carol]): Sending RevokeAndAck
//	[DBG] PEER brontide.go:2412: Peer([Carol]): Sending CommitSig
//	[DBG] PEER brontide.go:2412: Peer([Carol]): Received RevokeAndAck
//	[DBG] HSWC link.go:3617: ChannelLink([ChanPoint: Bob=>Carol]): settle-fail-filter: count=1, filter=[0]
//	[DBG] HSWC switch.go:3001: Circuit is closing for packet...
//
// Bob receives the preimage, closes the circuit, and exchanges commit sig and
// revoke msgs with Carol. Once Bob receives the `CommitSig` from Carol, the
// HTLC should be removed from his `LocalCommitment` via
// `RevokeCurrentCommitment`.
//
// However, in the test where `AssertHTLCNotActive` is called, although the
// above process is finished, the `ListChannelsâ€œ still finds the HTLC. Also note
// that the RPC makes direct call to the channeldb without any locks, which
// should be fine as the struct `OpenChannel.LocalCommitment` is passed by
// value, although we need to double check.
//
// TODO(yy): In order to fix it, we should make the RPC share the same view of
// our channel state machine. Instead of making DB queries, it should instead
// use `lnwallet.LightningChannel` instead to stay consistent.

//   - if we subscribe HTLC events immediately, we may get extra events, which
//     is also related to the above unfinished commitment dance.
//
